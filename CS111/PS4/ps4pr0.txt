Although seems to be ignored by the programmers, the data conversion is the fundamental and important part that makes the program functions as normal. That little bug in the program can lead to the valuable loss, which was caused by the careless of programmers. In contrast to mechanical failure, software failure do have more impact over the loss since almost all of the mechanic parts are controlled by software. In addition, software failure can occur easier because the code is, most of the time, more complicated and difficult to seek for the bugs.
