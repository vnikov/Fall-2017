To what extent do artificial languages (such as Python or Picobot) have the ability to shape human thought, if at all? Or are such languages fundamentally different from human ones, such as Guugu Yimithirr or English?

	In my opinion, artificial languages is the same as human languages since the goal is to communicate and make the listeners understand what the speakers want to communicate. Like Guugu Yimithirr that use geographic coordinate or English that usr egocentric coordinate to communicate the direction, artificial languages use special syntaxes and expressions that the listeners, in this case is computer, understand the content.
