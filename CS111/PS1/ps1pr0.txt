The article states that, whether in science or business, we “don’t have to settle for models at all.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement? How? And why? Certainly feel free to articulate a more nuanced or hybrid view, if you’d like.

Although the model is an obsolete method of imitating a system, it does not imply we should ignore it and utilize the modern technologies. Today’s technologies advise us in many aspects such as handling big data or computing difficult mathematical problems. Nonetheless, they might not urge us to understand the fundamental concepts since we do not have to know the underlying process in order to receive the output. On the other hand, using models is the better approach to the fundamental and basic concepts because we both know how does the system work and how can it gives us the output.
