In some situation, it might help me finding the thing that I cannot think of, especially when I have only a little hint about it. Suppose I was opening a radio on Spotify 3 weeks ago, but I've just realized the catchy rhythm of a particular song on that they and I cannot neither remember the lyrics or the name of it. This software can retrieve the name of songs played on that day or on a particular time by referring from other factors like I was reading /r/BostonU at that time. From my personal perspective, this software is nice but does not need to have.
