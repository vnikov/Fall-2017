Computer is similar to human in terms of thinking since both use logic-- and / or-- to evaluate the thought. However, human do not have solely logical thinking like computer. Instead, human integrate emotion and semantics into our thought, so the result will be more fine-tuned and profound. Since we have learned human language for our whole live, we are able to interpret the disguise context in the sentence. Like the two sentences mentioned int he text: "I deleted my Internet cookies" and "I deleted my files". Human can distinguish the difference category between "files" and "cookies". In contrast, computer evaluate both as the same category since the sentence patterns are the same. The core computing concept of computer is solely and only logic, but, as the machine learning field has been introduced along with the rapid development in computing performance, computer might be able to understand human language like we do.
