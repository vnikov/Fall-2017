The concept of biological computer is the breakthrough and mysterious discovery since we, although living in the modern science era, still cannot completely understand the cell mechanism. In the future, we might use our cell as a CPU to compute without carrying the A4-size laptop anymore. Apart from that, the scientists have not discovered the full potential in computation of cell yet, which means it might be more powerful than we thought. Although now can handling only simple tasks such as logical operations(AND OR) and playing tick-tac-toe, this is the good start: we, at least, can control the fundamental part of the organism, the cell.
