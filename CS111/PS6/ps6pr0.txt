Nowadays, RAM and CPU has faster clock speed and data transfer rate because of the smaller transistor and better architecture, so the time to transfer data is so tiny that it can be ignored. Regarding the second drawback, it is worth to code it only the first time and can call it anytime rather than creating it every time. Talking about a high-level language, one obvious advantage that I can think of is that it is more readable and understandable by human than the low-level or the machine language. Take Python as an example, the structures and the syntaxes are more similar to those in human-speaking language such as English. High-level language also makes it easier to cooperate with other programmers without a lot of explanations or comments since they can understand the purpose of most of the code by just looking at it.
