Inventing model has both pros and cons. Regarding the pros, it can visualize the future in order for us to prepare for it such as the weather model or the economics model. In contrast, model is not always accurate, which might lead to the wrong assumption. Take, for example, an economics model. The investor might loss from the investment if the model predicts the wrong situation. Moreover, model can make people inert. Let's take, for example, the weather model. Suppose it implies that the catastrophe will devilish most parts of the world in 2070. People will be less alert compared to when they do not know the prediction. They will prepare and alert for the disaster in every second.
