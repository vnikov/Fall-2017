2. if b < a:
       print('pound')	because the if a >= b will be evaluated first.
   elif b == c:
       print('mound')	because a must be less than b and mote than c, so a must 			be equal to a and c, which will correspond to the if a >= 			b first.
   if a == c:
       print('hound')	because a must be less than b and b must be less than c 			and a must be equal to c in order for this block to be 				excited. In the other word, a must be equal to b and equal 			to c, which will correspond to the if a >= b first.
