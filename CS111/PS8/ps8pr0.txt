Evolving programs are more dynamic and adaptive since it is not programmed to handle the specific task. The programs can learn, develop, and evolve themselves to handle the unexperienced tasks, which significantly reduce the burden of the programmers. However, the programmers have to take the new approach since many procedures of coding traditional programs might not be applied. Moreover, the other components like hardwares must be developed to correspond with this new concept of programming in order to make the invention functions as expected.
