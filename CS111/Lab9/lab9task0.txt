Fill in your answers to the questions in Task 0 below.

1. The constructor is called: __init__

   Every Point object has attributes called: x and y

   To create the specified Point objects from the Shell:

       >>> p1 = Point(3, 4)
       >>> p2 = Point(-5, -12)

3. The correct call is:  

       >>> c. p1.distance_from_origin()

4. The move_down() method does the following:

   It doesn't need to return a value because: the function needs to only modify the y value.


5. We see the following:

       >>> p1 == p2
       False

       >>> p1 == p3
       True
