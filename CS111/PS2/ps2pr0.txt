Many people might think that AI will replace human's jobs since AI, like Watson, has significantly advanced until it, in some aspect, is better than human. AI is specialize in many laborious fields such as handling big data, solving complex problems, and computing mathematical equations. Nonetheless, one thing that discriminates and surpasses human from AI is the sentiment. AI was trained by big data and derived the convoluted neural network to handle new data; on the other hand, human not only analyze and interpret data, we develop further and include our feeling and emotion, which is an unique feature of human brain.
