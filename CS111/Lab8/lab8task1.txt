1.
- 2 distinct lists
- 2 variable: a and c

- [4, 5, 6]
- from 0 to 2
- when the loop has gone through all elements in values

- a = [0, 1, 2]   b = [4, 5, 6]   c = [0, 1, 2]   x = 5
- x is immutable, so the value does not change. a and c point to the same memory address, so the changes made during the function affects both variables. b refers to the different memory address with the same value as the original value of a.
